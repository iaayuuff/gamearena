  <h1>Independence Day Free Fire Poster Prompt (15 August)</h1>
  <p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br>
    Create a highly detailed, realistic digital poster for India's Independence Day. Place [CHARACTER DESCRIPTION] standing proudly with a slightly tilted head looking upward holding a tattered but waving Indian national flag (Tiranga). Set the character in front of a dramatic, fiery battlefield-like background with intense orange and red clouds, glowing embers, and a powerful aura of patriotism. Include cinematic lighting and shadows for a movie-poster vibe. Add India Gate or iconic Indian monument in the background. Include bold text reading "HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY - 15 AUGUST 2025" in the upper section of the poster. Emphasize realism, epic mood, and national pride.
