        148 <br><br>
        cinematic digital poster for a Free Fire MAX player. In the background, clearly display the uploaded profile screenshot without hiding or blurring any part. The image should remain sharp and readable every detail that naturally appears in the profile (such as stats, icons, text, badges numbers, tags, button) must be fully visible and understandable to the viewer. In the foreground, place the uploaded character image standing in a proud, victorious pose -with both arm stretched outward (T-pose). The character's head is tilted slightly upward, facing the sky, giving a heroic and thankful expression. Include a glowing blue sword by his side and his pet standing nearby. Add a dramatic rain, flying money, cinematic glow, and soft shadows to enhance the atmosphere. Use contrast to make sure both the character and the profile are clearly visible and not overlapping confusingly. In the centre of the poster overlay bold, glowing, 3D gaming-style text "YOUR NAME" with a bleeding black red blood and blood must come from text to down side floating gradient.
